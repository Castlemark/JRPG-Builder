# JRPG Builder

JRPG Builder is an application that lets you build JRPG games without programming. You only need JSON files and multimedia resources (images, audio, video, ...) to create content.

The goal is to create an application designed to facilitate content creation and Game-making to people who are not familiar with programming.

Although creating content is quite easy, every type of game element must follow certain restrictions, these restrictions can be JSON file structure, image size, folder structure, etc. Guidelines will be posted on this repository's wiki as gameplay elements are finalized.

Below you'll find some deadlines for the various modules, when a module is marked with **final** it means all gameplay elements from that module will not change in the near future. As elements are completed they will be marked as such. Please keep in mind this dates are not set in stone.
