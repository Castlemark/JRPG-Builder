# JRPG Builder

JRPG Builder is an application that lets you build JRPG games without programming. You only need JSON files and multimedia resources to create content.

The goal is to create an application designed to facilitate content creation and Game-making to people who are not familiar with programming.

Although creating content is quite easy, every type of game element must follow certain restrictions, these restrictions can be JSON file structure, image size, folder structure, etc.
